# Java Boilerplate #01
- Are you tired of writting "System.out.println()", just to print a single line Java? I have a solution for it! Enter the 6 line of code (@print.java) in your Java program to use:
- println() as System.out.println() and
- print() as System.out.print(), for printing String in the output
